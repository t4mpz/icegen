# ICEGEN a simple iceberg generator

It's a simple code that generates text on some part of an image and finds the best position to it, considering the total area of the text in that space. These space are called in the code viewports.

## Code status
The status of this project is: I made the hard part of it now the simple part is making it read JSON files with the images specifications and creating a menu. I say the hard part is done because it doesn't view the image neither checks pixels on it, all the *magic* with the text place finding mechanism is solely using maths and boolean algebra to work, and it was **vewwy hawwd** to make this by hand using desmos to represent the text areas and my two last braincells. Anyways, I'll probably return to this project after sometime, because I'm lazy and tired enough from work and college. I'm also just setting this here for GitHub nourishment.
